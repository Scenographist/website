        <p>
          These cookies are necessary for the Site to function and cannot be switched off in our systems.
          They are usually only set in response to actions made by you such as logging in, filling in forms,
          or setting privacy preferences.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Performance and Analytics Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
          These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with the Site by collecting information
          anonymously. This allows us to improve functionality, performance, and user experience.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Functionality Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
          These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as language, region, or login status)
          and provide enhanced, more personalized features.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Marketing and Advertising Cookies</strong></p>

          These cookies may be set through our Site by advertising partners to build a profile of your interests

        </p>

        <h3>3. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Some cookies may be placed by third-party services that appear on our pages, such as analytics providers,
          payment processors, customer support tools, or embedded media services. We do not control these cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third-party providers may include services such as Google Analytics, Stripe, Intercom, or similar tools
          used to operate and improve the Services.

        <h3>5. Managing Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          You can control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Most browsers allow you to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>View what cookies are stored</li>
          <li>Delete all or specific cookies</li>
          <li>Block third-party cookies</li>

        <h3>6. Do Not Track Signals</h3>
        <p>
          Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature. At this time, we do not respond to DNT signals
          because there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Legal Basis for Processing (EU/UK Users)</h3>

          For users in the European Union and United Kingdom, we process essential cookies based on legitimate

          based on your consent where required by law.
        </p>
